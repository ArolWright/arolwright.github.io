# Get to know me better!

I've been working as a freelance tech journalist since 2017, and it's been a fantastic ride.  I'm currently a senior writer at _[How-To Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/author/arolwright/)_, which I joined in August 2022. 

Before _How-To Geek_, I had the pleasure of contributing to some other awesome publications. I wrote for _[Android Police](https://androidpolice.com/author/arol-wright)_ from 2021 to 2023, for _[MakeUseOf](https://www.makeuseof.com/author/arol-wright)_ from 2021 to 2024, and got my start at _[XDA-Developers](https://www.xda-developers.com/author/arol-wright)_, where I wrote from 2017 to 2021. Each experience has helped me grow as a writer and deepen my understanding of the ever-changing tech landscape.

Writing about technology has always been a passion of mine. If you're curious about the nitty-gritty details of my work history, feel free to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arolwright/) profileâ€”it's all there.

Outside of the tech world, people have generally described me as a pretty laid-back and friendly guy. I'm a native speaker of both Spanish and English, and I'm always looking to expand my linguistic horizons. Some of my other passions include hitting the gym, learning how to do new stuff, and reading.
