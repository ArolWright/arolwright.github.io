# Get to know me better!

{% photo %}

Since 2017, I have worked as a freelance tech journalist at several websites. I currently work for [How-To Geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/author/arolwright/) as a News Writer, where I have worked since August 2022. Previously, I used to work at [Android Police](https://androidpolice.com/author/arol-wright), [MakeUseOf](https://www.makeuseof.com/author/arol-wright), and [XDA-Developers](https://www.makeuseof.com/author/arol-wright). Writing about technology has always been a dream job for me, and I am grateful for the opportunity to make a living from it. You can look through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arolwright/) if you want to know more about my work history in detail.

I'm Venezuelan-American and I currently live in Caracas, Venezuela. People would usually describe me as a pretty nice guy.

I speak Spanish and English natively, and I want to learn a few additional languages.
